#  Contribute to Daily Italian

Daily Italian is a simple app. You can help me build it by reporting and fixing translation mistakes.

## Report a Translation Mistake

[Open a new issue in this repo](https://github.com/jungaretti/daily-language/issues/new) for each mistake that you find. Your issue should describe the mistake and include a link to the correct translation on [WordReference](https://www.wordreference.com/).

## Fix a Translation Mistake

You can find all of Daily Italian's translations in the [`LanguageKit/Translations`](https://github.com/jungaretti/daily-language/tree/main/LanguageKit/Translations) directory. Follow these steps to fix a translation mistake:

1. Find the mistake in its language's `.swift` file. For example, [line 16 of `Italian.swift`](https://github.com/jungaretti/daily-language/blob/main/LanguageKit/Translations/Italian.swift#L16).
2. [Edit the file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files) and fix the translation error. You can [edit the file on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files) or [clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and use your favorite editor.
3. Commit your change and [open a new pull request](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lGpZkjnkt4) with your fix.
